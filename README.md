# Password Generator

## Description

As a company that wants to make sure that our information is secure, we wanted a password generator for our employees to have a secure password that meets a criteria of 8-128 characters. 
Created this program makes it easy for the employees to generate a new password for when ever they need one. 
Throughout the process of developing the algorithm for this, I learned how to work better with functions, and how variables are in scope or global scope. As well as understanding how event listeners work.
## Installation

## Usage

Once you hit the generate button, the program will prompt you for questions regarding the password that you want to generate.

- Choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- Do you want to use numbers? (y/n)
- Do you want to use lowercase letters? (y/n)
- Do you want to use uppercase letters? (y/n)
- Do you want to use special characters? (y/n)

You will be instructed to answer the questions in a Y or N format.
Than the program will add into the specific categories into the password and generate a password for you at the end following the criteria.
